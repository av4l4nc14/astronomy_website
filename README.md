As a blooming area of research , centre of astronomy at IIT Indore was constituted in December 2015 to foster the rapid developments in astronomy and encourage young minds to contribute towards these developments. In its initiation stage the centre of astronomy needs to timely update its web-page and track all the advancements in astronomy .

Under our CS258 course we are working to create a template of the website for astronomy centre at IIT Indore.

The project members include Apoorva Joshi, Utkarsh Kumar Singh, Bandaru Harsh Vardhan and Rohith Bellamkonda
